    <h5>Welcome!</h5>
    <p>Billminder is a simple little web application, here to help you find some peace about a
        daily life issue that hounds everyone: balancing your budget.
        Visualizing your bill schedule, combined with your income, allows you, at a glance,
        to understand your expenses and confidently manage them.
        Peace of mind comes quickly when you can see where everything is in relation to
        everything else, and are able to keep on top of things that were invisible before.</p>
    <p>I built this to use myself, because I was waking up in the middle of the night worrying that I forgot something, and,
        especially when traveling, I wouldn't have access to my regular tracking spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>This turned out so good, I thought I'd share it with others, who have the same concerns.</p>

        <h5>You've Got This!</h5>
    <p><b>Lets get started:</b>  Click on <span role='button' onclick="dashboard.add('entry', false);"> [&nbsp;<i class='fa-regular fa-plus '></i>&nbsp;New Expense&nbsp;]</span> to input your first expense.</p>
    <p>Click on <span role='button' onclick="dashboard.add('entry', true);">[&nbsp;<i class='fa-regular fa-plus'></i>&nbsp;New Income&nbsp;]</span> to input your first source of income.</p>
    <p>As you add more expenses and income sources, you'll see how they fall out visually,
        and eventually you'll have a flow of income and expenses, which will allow you to
        confidently look to managing your spending outside your basic budget.</p>
    <p>There is <span role='button' onclick="help.show();">[&nbsp;<i class='fa-regular fa-person-drowning'></i> Help&nbsp;]</span> at every turn.</p>
