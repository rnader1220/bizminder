<p>Billminder is a simple little web application, here to help you find some peace
    about a daily life issue that hounds everyone: balancing your budget.
    Visualizing your bill schedule, combined with your income, allows you, at a glance,
    to understand your expenses and confidently manage them.
    Peace of mind comes quickly when you can see where everything is in relation to everything else,
    and are able to keep on top of things that were invisible before.</p>

<p>Click on a row in your bill list to see details about each entry.  There is a help text for each page.</p>
